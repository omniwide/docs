Most services being offered these days are encrypted, though there is some level of decisions and knowledge that home users need to be aware of. This has become a critical point in keeping yourself safe and for businesses and governments to keep sensitive data protected. Encryption wasn\u2019t really discussed or implemented much for the average user until the last ten to fifteen years. Businesses and governments have been using it for quite a long time, and there's really good reasons to.</p> <p>Encryption is also not a singular approach to something. You should strive to have your operating system encrypted, as well as emails, messages, documents that are stored locally or on the cloud, etc. Every now and then, there are morally disingenuous arguments made against encryption by some jackwagon saying something like, \"why should you want your stuff encrypted if you have nothing to hide?\"</p> <p>That's a stupid comment that\u2019s meant to gaslight people that aren\u2019t tech savvy. Many corporations and governments would like to have the ability to spy on people more than they already do. If you have someone make a comment like that to you, keep in mind that they don\u2019t have your best interests in mind or they are grossly misinformed on the topic.</p> <p>Why encryption should matter to you</p> <p>I see the word \"encryption\" getting thrown around a lot like it's a buzzword, but it's really important to pay attention to. It's how you keep your data private. Anything not encrypted can be easily stolen. Using encryption should be just as standard as locking your door.</p> <p>As for how to go about this, that isn\u2019t a simple answer. The field of cryptography is a deep specialization of its own. Each operating system has its own method of encryption, sometimes open source and sometimes closed source, some are more vulnerable than others to exploits, some apps have data that\u2019s encrypted, some don\u2019t, and so on.</p> <p>MacOS, Windows, and Linux all have their own methods for encryption. The native approach is the one I would recommend, i.e. use BitLocker with Windows and use LUKS with Linux. Sometimes, the encryption is done automatically on the device, such as with Apple (as long as you use a passcode). There are also other options available, like using VeraCrypt which can be used for full disk encryption or even creating hidden encrypted drives if you need plausible deniability.</p> <p>As for things like messages, emails, and cloud storage, that gets more complicated. Some apps and services that claim to be encrypted are actually massive data collection machines and some have been caught doing nefarious things with customer data. Whatever you use requires some careful searching and due diligence to figure out what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not. I cover some of these in the software considerations section.</p> <p>Another important area to consider is how many Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being used now. Just about everything seems to have an internet connection these days, whether it's a thermostat, a microwave, or a washing machine. Putting the security risk of those devices aside, you really need to consider how you're securing your home network, i.e. are you using WPA3 with a strong password?</p>"},{"location":"opsec/encryption/#encryption-in-detail","title":"Encryption In Detail","text":"<p>There's quite a lot to explain here, so I'll start with the overview first. There's a few different types of encryption. There's symmetric encryption which is when the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt info. One of the common algorithms that uses this is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Typically when you see this, you see something like AES-128 or AES-256. I'll explain more on the numbers later. This algorithm is used quite a lot for encrypting data that's \"at rest,\" meaning it's stored on something like a hard drive. BitLocker for example uses AES.</p> <p>Then there's asymmetric encryption. This is where a public and a private key are used. The public key is openly shared, but the private key stays with the device (or owner). When there's communication between two parties, the sender uses the receivers public key to encrypt the message. The receivers private key is then used to decrypt it. An common example of this is during a TLS handshake.</p> <p>The other method is hybrid encryption. This is where asymmetric is used for the key exchange due to the security benefits, and symmetric encryption is used for the data transmission, due to the speed benefits. You'll usually see this with cloud storage like Dropbox and with some VPN providers.</p> <p>Here's some of the encryption protocols that are used:</p> <ul> <li>SSL (Secure Socket Layer)/TLS (Transport Layer Security): You'll usually hear SSL being used (like someone referring to an SSL certificate). The last version of SSL came out in 1996 and was replaced with TLS. TLS 1.3 was released in 2018 and is in the process of being rolled out now to replace TLS 1.2.</li> <li>SSH (Secure Shell): This is for remote login to a server and to manage file transfers. SSH operates on port 22 (more on that in the firewalls section).</li> <li>HTTPS (Hyper Text Transport Protocol Secure): This is used to encrypt web traffic, i.e. a person visiting a merchant site. HTTPS uses port 443.</li> <li>PGP (Pretty Good Privacy): This is used for encrypting emails and requires setup from a person to be able to use. This can be used to enhance security as email is considered highly insecure.</li> </ul> <p>I could list more, though this should give you a good starting point. There's plenty more to discuss on encryption anyway. Now, let's talk about hashes and salting.</p> <p>A hash is used to take something like a password and turn it into a string of characters. If you were to take the same input, i.e. a password, it would produce the same hash. This is a secure way to store something like passwords for a place such as a website. For example, if you ever do a forgot password request to a website and they send you an email with your actual password in the email, that's a problem and signals they don't have proper security practices. Many hackers have discovered files on company devices where the file was a database of unhashed passwords, which then damages the reputation of the company for having garbage security practices.</p> <p>Hashing is done by using an algorithm, similar to the encryption examples I have above. One of the most commonly used ones now is SHA-256. This is also used for things like data integrity and should be used in place of older algorithms like MD5. An example of this being used is sometimes when you download a file, the dev will say to verify the hash so you can verify the file wasn't tampered with. If the hash is different, then the file shouldn't be trusted. Even the tiniest change to the file will cause an entirely different hash to generate.</p> <p>To use a website example, when you login to a site, the password you put in is hashed and compared to the hash stored on the website database. This way, hackers and people that work at that company can't see your password.</p> <p>Let's say you use a password like \"applejacks!00.\" The resulting hash would be a string of random characters and numbers such as:</p> <p>dffd6021bb2bd5b0af676290809ec3a53191dd81c7f70a4b28688a362182986f</p> <p>Now let's add to this. Hashes are able to be salted. A salt is a random string that gets added with the password when the hash is made. With just a hash, two people could use the same password and it would generate the same hash. You can probably see why this is a security issue, especially in the context of large platforms, like Amazon. When a salt is added, those same passwords will end up with completely different hashes. If you took the above example hash, it would look completely different when salted:</p> <p>38638fc079df32cd598550f94cf65b7f138c68cf2dff3c7d74a94fe851759ba2</p> <p>With a salt, that hash will look entirely different every time, even though the password is the same.</p> <p>One last note is regarding the key length. I mentioned earlier about AES-256. In the context of AES as an example, you'll see 128 and 256 bits. This is the key length. The longer it is, the stronger the encryption is. This is why you'll see places like intelligence agencies recommend using 256 bit. The other important aspect is that we are on the brink of quantum computing. 256 bit is going to be a lot more resistant to being broken by a quantum computer than something that's 128 bit.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/encryption/#what-youll-see","title":"What you'll see","text":"<p>Now that you've got a grasp of how this works, let's talk about what you'll see in a more practical way. When you see encryption mentioned, you'll sometimes come across some meaningless garbage like \"military grade encryption.\" There's different ways encryption can be used and sometimes companies will use it to paint a different picture than what is actually being done.</p> <p>First, \"military grade encryption\" is just how standard encryption should be done. For example, the NSA uses AES-256, but so does something like BitLocker when it encrypts the files of a home user (with a caveat discussed more in the BitLocker section). When you see those words thrown around, it was probably someone on the marketing team who thought that sounded cool, but it really doesn't mean much.</p> <p>Then there's the issue of if you are the only one with the keys, or if someone else has keys as well. In the case of cloud storage, any files uploaded will be encrypted (at least with reputable providers), but this doesn't mean that only you can see them. The provider may have them encrypted on their servers, but if they hold the keys, they can (and many do) snoop through your files. If you don't believe this, take a look at the terms of service and privacy policies for the providers.</p> <p>The ideal way of handling this is with something called zero knowledge encryption. This is where only you hold the keys. While this is great, the increased security does have a downside. You must make sure that you never forget your password, or whatever it is that's encrypted will be gone forever. One example that I'll cover later is Cryptomator. They allow you to encrypt your files before they ever go to a cloud provider, so no one can snoop through your files. That also means that you are entirely responsible for the password to decrypt them.</p> <p>There are more and more options coming available for people to be able to use zero knowledge. Another example that's becoming well known is Apple's Advanced Data Protection. It's a way for someone to back up their Apple data but not allow Apple to have the keys anymore. If the password is lost, then their data is gone.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If you're going to use zero knowledge encryption, you will be entirely responsible for your password! Whatever data was encrypted will be gone forever if you forget your password. Whoever was providing the encryption won't have a way for you to recover your password. Plan accordingly before using any zero knowledge methods!</p> <p>Now, just because something isn't zero knowledge doesn't mean that you shouldn't use it. That decision is something you need to make, but there's plenty of services, apps, etc, that aren't zero knowledge that are great and I don't have an issue with using. A service could have encryption where they hold the keys but be something that's okay to use.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/encryption/#applying-encryption-to-your-digital-life","title":"Applying encryption to your digital life","text":"<p>Let's talk about working encryption into your digital life. If you are new to this, I recommend you start small and work up from there. For example, maybe your want to move to an encrypted messaging service like Signal, turn on BitLocker or LUKS, encrypt your cloud files, and so on.</p> <p>As far as tools are concerned, there's plenty to choose from depending on what it is that you want to do. For example, if you just wanted to encrypt a couple files, you could use something like Cryptomator, but if you want to encrypt your entire hard drive, you would need to use something like BitLocker.</p> <p>Limitations of encryption</p> <p>Encryption is not the end-all be-all of keeping data safe. For example, if you get a virus on your computer, your private data is likely going to get exfiltrated off the computer. Also, you really need to take the password seriously. The best encryption algorithm in the world won't protect against a weak password. Using something like \"password\" will be broken almost instantly with a dictionary attack. You should use at least 12 characters with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Also, make sure you remember your passwords, otherwise you can lose all your data!</p>"},{"location":"opsec/encryption/#tools","title":"Tools","text":"<p>You'll need to pick the right tool, depending on what it is that you're trying to do. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but gives you some options and ideas of what can be used.</p> <p>Full Disk Encryption (FDE):</p> <ul> <li>BitLocker: This is used to encrypt drives on Windows operating systems. The setup and configuration is quite detailed. Refer to the BitLocker section for more info.</li> <li>LUKS: This is used for full disk encryption for Linux distros. It's a PITA to do this after the distro is installed, so it's best to do it beforehand.</li> <li>VeraCrypt: This is an open source tool that replaced TrueCrypt. It can be used with Windows, Linux, and Mac.</li> </ul> <p>Encryption For Cloud Providers, Files &amp; Folders:</p> <ul> <li>Cryptomator: Many people use this to encrypt files and folders before they get uploaded to a cloud storage provider (i.e. OneDrive), but this is also an excellent option if you just wanted to encrypt something and keep it on your computer. There are other options available, but Cryptomator works very well and is open source.</li> </ul> <p>Note on cloud encryption</p> <p>All reputable cloud storage providers should be using encryption, though not all of them have zero knowledge encryption. You need to consider the sensitivity of the files. If the provider were to be hacked and the private keys they held were compromised, your personal data could be seen. If you use something like Cryptomator, you're adding an extra layer of encryption to hedge against a scenario like that. You also have to consider the usability as well. It provides more security, but it will add more hassle every time you need to access or update files.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/nationstates/","title":"Nation State Actors","text":"<p>I\u2019ll give you fair warning now that what I\u2019m about to say isn\u2019t popular opinion and many of you reading this are going to get pissed off. I made a section dedicated to nation state actors, as I thought it was needed.</p> <p>Let\u2019s define a nation state actor. This can be a collective government, such as the US Government, where there may be multiple branches involved, a law enforcement agency like the FBI, or an intelligence agency like GCHQ or the NSA. Then there are groups of these nation state actors. This can be things like Five Eyes or Fourteen Eyes - groups like that are part of a massive intelligence apparatus.</p> <p>Many of these agencies have been around for decades. There are a lot of good books that talk about the intel community. Some of the more notable ones that I like are The Sword and The Shield, and Enemies : A History of the FBI. Things like spies and covert warfare have existed as long as man has been around.</p> <p>Book Recommendations</p> <p>I strongly recommend you read some books about the intelligence community. There are a lot of great options besides what I have recommended. It will give a lot of clarity of why they exist and what they are capable of. There's a lot of opinions that people give, many of which are poorly informed. Hearing both sides is important to having a healthy point of view.</p> <p>Between WW1 and WW2 was when a lot of these agencies started to grow and their capabilities started to increase. A lot of it was due to the technology that was being made available, as well as the civilian population adopting more tech. For example, in older days, if an operative wanted to overhear a conversation, they had to be on site and stay out of sight. Once things like hidden mics and wiretaps came about, many of these activities became a lot easier and one agent could do much more intel gathering.</p> <p>One of the more famous spy devices used in those days was something called the Great Seal bug. The Soviet Union gave it to a US ambassador in 1945 and it wasn\u2019t discovered until 1951. It used a radio signal to activate the device and the bug didn\u2019t have a power supply. It was finally discovered by a British radio operator who heard Americans talking on a Soviet Air Force radio channel as they beamed radio waves to the ambassador's office. There\u2019s a lot more detail to how this worked, so feel free to Google it if you want.</p> <p>Then there was something called TEMPEST which was used by the NSA. This method allows eavesdropping of an LCD or CRT monitor by using electromagnetic emissions. Something like this would allow an operative to be some distance away from you and see everything that\u2019s on your computer screen. This is an instance where having an air gapped computer wouldn\u2019t do any good.</p> <p>Then of course, there were all the revelations that came from Snowden, including the tool called Xkeyscore. This is discussed in more depth in his book, Permanent Record. It\u2019s a good read and will give more detail about what the NSA was capable of 15 years ago.</p> <p>Now we\u2019re in 2023. The leaps in technology for the civilian market have been massive since then. Something you also have to keep in mind is that the government is always years ahead of what the general public has available to them. Then there\u2019s the fact that places like the NSA and CIA have top talent working for them. Some people like to throw crap at them and bring up mistakes made here and there, but mistakes will happen to anyone, and overall, these agencies are really damn good at what they do.</p> <p>Now here\u2019s my point. I see a lot of people freak out about being spied on by intel agencies and think that flocking to something like Linux and using Librewolf and a VPN will magically protect them from being visible. If you decide to go down the rabbit hole of what these agencies have been able to do and can picture what they are even remotely capable of today, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a fool's gambit.</p> <p>If you ever do something stupid and draw the attention of a nation state actor, at least in your home country or somewhere that\u2019s allied to your home country, you\u2019re cooked and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Even if you happen to be in a country that\u2019s not allied with your home country, you still aren\u2019t safe. Again, reading some intel books will really clarify this for you.</p> <p>So stop worrying about them. If you aren\u2019t doing anything stupid, you won\u2019t draw their attention. They know everything about you and they\u2019ll be able to see everything you do regardless of what tactics you try to employ. No one on this planet is able to hide themselves from an apparatus like the Fourteen Eyes, no matter how smart that person might think they are. Many people also have no idea how many points of data are collected and how all of it puts a mosaic together that shows every little detail of their lives; the music they listen to, the food they like, what their belief systems are, what their hobbies are, and so on.</p> <p>Now, regardless of what you believe, these agencies play a very important role in you being able to sleep soundly at night. If we didn\u2019t have agencies like the NSA, CIA, GCHQ, and so on, our enemies would be able to destroy us from the inside. Read up on the Colonial Pipeline attack. Now imagine that on a country wide scale where the enemies do that to pipelines, power stations, water treatment plants, etc. I\u2019m well aware this was a hacker group but don\u2019t think nation state actors wouldn\u2019t do it and aren\u2019t planning it as you read this. Cyber warfare has become much more effective than traditional warfare and is the way of the future of how nations will fight.</p> <p>These agencies are doing a lot behind the scenes to keep attackers at bay. Many times, they work with businesses when they find out a foreign actor is trying to hack into one. They also release a lot of publications that outline steps to take to mitigate threats and increase security. NSA puts out some pretty good publications, even if they are somewhat dry to read. They also play an important offensive role against foreign actors.</p> <p>After reading all that, I\u2019m sure many of you are pissed off, since many people like to have a boogeyman to point to and a shadow government agency fits the bill for many. To be blunt, I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like what I wrote. There are certain realities about the world and one of them is that you can't hide from an intelligence agency. Agencies like the NSA truly don\u2019t give a damn about a random Joe. Their job is to stop an attack and to do it requires casting a large net and sifting through a lot of data. Everyone is free to do what they want, but I won\u2019t live my life in paranoia over an NSA employee seeing what I do on my computer. They aren\u2019t the people I\u2019m concerned about.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/opsecintro/","title":"OPSEC Intro","text":"<p>This section covers operation security (OPSEC). Much of the knowledge here is focused on the \"theory\" of cybersecurity. This is one of the most important sections on this site, because the focus on mostly on the person, not on the device. It's worth repeating that the biggest vulnerability is the person. Most infections of a device, a scam, etc, can be attributed to a person either not knowing what they are doing or being careless. In addition to this section, check out the book recommendations to learn more about this topic and ways to protect yourself.</p> <p>OPSEC is an acronym that is used frequently in the government, usually within the intelligence communities and the military. There was a popular World War 2 phrase which was, \u201cLoose lips sink ships.\u201d It was a catch phrase for people to think about what they were going to say and to think about who might hear it. The idea carried on through WW2, into the Cold War and now to present day, to help prevent spies from learning critical secrets.</p> <p>There\u2019s also other acronyms like PERSEC (personal security) and COMSEC (communications security). To keep things simple, I just use OPSEC when something would actually be considered PERSEC or COMSEC.</p> <p>There are a lot of facets to cover when it comes to staying safe online and this guide could never cover all the different and some seemingly insignificant ways that highly sensitive information could leak out. A common idea has been that once something is posted on the internet, that it is there forever. There is some nuance to that, but it is true. For example, just because you delete a post on Facebook doesn\u2019t mean it goes away. Facebook will keep an archive of it. I\u2019ll cover data retention laws later on.</p> <p>Another aspect that many people don't consider is that a determined hacker or scammer can piece together a lot of info. I see plenty of posts online of people doing things like taking those ridiculous quizzes where they say how old they are, what they like to eat, where they were born, etc. Many of those places are mining the hell out of that data and it creates more issues for the people that post that info. An important aspect of OPSEC is that you think about what you're going to post or info you're putting into a website before you actually enter anything.</p> <p>I cover some of the most significant areas to consider in the following sections, which includes social media usage, keeping personal information limited online, keeping your devices safe regarding physical access, considerations when using public wifi, deleting metadata, how you are fingerprinted online, etc.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/physicalaccess/","title":"Physical Access/Alarm System","text":"<p>There\u2019ve been some recent articles popping up about phones being stolen and people having entire accounts being taken over. In addition to phones, you need to make sure you are properly securing your laptops, tablets, desktop computers, etc, from people that could access them. This could be anything from a thief getting it to someone trying to spy on what you\u2019re doing when you\u2019re not with the device.</p> <p>First, don\u2019t let someone else have access to your devices. Not everyone knows what they are doing, and others have bad intentions. If you let someone else use your phone or computer, they could do anything from install malware on it through negligence, to stealing personal information, to installing a keylogger. One common example is people that deal with psychotic exes who install tracking software to see all the activity of that person. There's also plenty of Reddit threads of people posting about how their computer got a virus or had their password changed after letting someone else use it.</p> <p>Second, you need to make sure all of your data is encrypted. Encryption is not going to keep you totally safe, but it sure as hell plays a huge role in keeping your data private. In the case of phones, many of them, such as the iPhone, use encryption by default as long as it has a passcode - they also rely on the user to have a strong passcode. Desktops are a little more complicated, so refer to other sections of the site to see in depth how to secure your devices. If your device is encrypted and you use a strong passcode, an attacker won\u2019t be able to see the info on it.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/physicalaccess/#alarm-system","title":"Alarm System","text":"<p>The third consideration is to have your residence monitored by a security system. These systems include quite a few different options, like door and window sensors, motions sensors, temperature sensors, cameras, and so on. There's quite a few providers these days and a lot of them are DIY systems that you can install yourself and don't have to get yourself locked into a contract. I'll be covering alarms systems and some things you need to consider if you're going to use on.</p> <p>Before going any further, many people reading this site probably factor privacy in at some level. If you're going to use a security system, it will absolutely lower your privacy level. It's just the nature of how alarm systems work. To have one that works properly, it requires being able to monitor many different things inside your home. I know some people have strong feelings about these systems, but they absolutely can be lifesavers. Ring cameras (the concept of the camera system, not just the brand) could save you from someone trying to attack you and allow police time to get there. This is something the military would call an \"early warning system.\"</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Self monitored alarm systems are an option where only you have the ability to see and respond to what's going on. While it's your decision what you want to do, I don't recommend using a self monitored system. If you were to miss a notification on your phone of something happening, it doesn't do you much good to even have a system in the first place. Monitoring options are cheap and effective. It's better for a monitoring center to be able to send emergency responders to your house automatically, rather than you having to constantly manage the system.</p> <p>Alarm Permit</p> <p>If you've decided you want to install a system, you'll need to check with the government office in your area. A lot of governments will require you to have an alarm permit. This is so they know the name of the person(s) responsible for managing the alarm and have a way to contact them.</p> <p>Don't overlook this step! If you decide to install an alarm and something happens where emergency responders show up and you didn't have a permit, you could face fines and legal action.</p> <p>When you pick out a system, it's best to figure out what parts of your home you want to monitor and how you want to do it. There's a lot of different sensor types available. You could either choose to use all of them or just ones that you think will give you the best coverage with the least amount of hassle.</p> <p>When people think of alarm systems, they usually think of things like motion sensors and door/window sensors, but they might not consider something like smoke detectors or water/temperature sensors. If you're going to monitor things like doors and windows, why not also include smoke and water as well? An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you install a few water sensors near areas like plumbing rooms and underneath your sinks, it could potentially save you tens of thousands of dollars and months of headache by being able to catch a problem when something breaks instead of hours later when half the house is soaked with water.</p> <p>You'll also need to figure out where you want your keypad(s). I recommend you check reviews and customer feedback for the different providers. Make sure you pick a system that will still send an alarm if the keypad gets smashed. This is something that a burglar may decide to do if they break into a house.</p> <p>You'll also get something called a base station, which is basically a hub that manages everything from the backend. Make sure this gets put somewhere safe and don't tell other people about it! Some base stations will send an alarm if they are damaged but some won't. If you use something that doesn't have this feature, the base station needs to be well hidden (it should be hidden anyway) and the alarm should activate in a short enough time that an attacker won't be able to figure out where it's at before an alarm is sent.</p> <p>If you're going to have multiple people that can turn the alarm on and off, they should each get their own PIN. This is useful for a few different reasons. First, only you should have access to make changes to the alarm system and this is usually done with a master PIN. Second, every time someone comes and goes, there'll be a notification of who it was. If something happened to the house while you were away, this can give a better indication of who was around. Third, you can easily remove someone if they violate trust, which could be something like sharing the PIN with someone who you didn't give permission to come into your house.</p> <p>Another essential for alarm systems is to have a camera system. Most of them have cloud backups in case you need to access the footage at a later date. The retention time varies, but it seems that about a month is pretty standard. This is definitely one of the most important parts of the system. Having sensors by themselves is fine, but cameras can allow you to actually see if there's a problem - i.e. burglar in your house or a burst pipe flooding the basement. Every once in a while, you may have a sensor malfunction and tell you there's a problem when there isn't.</p> <p>System checks</p> <p>Every once in a while, you should check your alarm system for firmware updates and run tests on the sensors to make sure everything is working like it's supposed to. You'll need to replace batteries once in a while and you might also notice a sensor is starting to fail. You'll need to refer to the documentation for the alarm system provider you choose to see how to put the system in test mode. If anything isn't working like it should, you need to get the issue fixed ASAP. Procrastination on this could have severe consequences.</p> <p>As far as monitoring goes, I strongly recommend you have 24/7 monitoring enabled. Something that's important is that you have the alarm app for your system installed on your phone so anytime you're away from the residence, you can see whatever sensor is activated. You'll also want to make sure the alarm monitoring service phone number is saved on your phone.</p> <p>Your Responsibilities</p> <p>If you decide to use an alarm system, it is your full responsibility to make sure it stays in good working order and that you respond promptly to any alarms. If an alarm is activated and you don't answer when the monitoring company calls, they'll send emergency responders to check (they may send responders regardless). If there is a sensor that malfunctioned or there was an accidental activation, you need to let the alarm company know as soon as possible. You may also be contacted by emergency responders.</p> <p>Many localities will levy civil penalties against the people responsible for the alarm system if it was a false alarm, which includes things like a malfunctioning sensor. You are also responsible for making sure that it doesn't get misused. If you or someone else decided to \"test it out\" to see what happens, you could be jailed and fined for misuse of emergency services.</p> <p>The other reason I recommend you have a monitoring plan is because many of the providers include a cell data backup option. If your internet were to ever go out for any period of time, you would still have alarm coverage if you have cell data backup. Self monitored systems usually won't have this as an option.</p> <p>I don't have any specific recommendations for a security system provider. I'm not affiliated or sponsored by any of them either. Like I continue to say on this site, you need to use due diligence and make that determination for yourself. If you are considering a system, I strongly recommend you read some unbiased reviews as well as customer feedback. Reddit tends to be a pretty good place to go to see if users have any issues with their systems. I also would recommend that you avoid any review sites that have obvious monetization for their reviews. One of the biggest red flags is one that has affiliate links for that product nested on the page. It's hard to take what they say seriously if they get paid to send someone to buy a product.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/securityprivacy/","title":"Security, Privacy &amp; Anonymity","text":"<p>There is a huge difference between staying secure, having privacy, and being anonymous. There are times these all go hand in hand, but there are a lot of times they diverge from one another by a lot. Here's an easy way to look at it. Security is meant to protect you against having your data accessed or stolen. Privacy is about keeping your data and activities private. Anonymity is what keeps your identity secret and keeps you untraceable.</p> <p>An example of the divergence of the three aspects is the use of an antivirus suite. Let\u2019s say you want to open a program on your computer, such as a game. The antivirus suite will scan the file before it opens to make sure it isn\u2019t malicious. The way most modern AV works is to upload that sample to the cloud where it is checked for malicious behavior. If you\u2019re using a Windows PC, you absolutely must use AV to prevent infection. Putting aside the telemetry on Windows, the use of AV makes you more secure, but lowers your anonymity and privacy.</p> <p>Another example for AV software is the inspection of SSL traffic, which lets the AV look at the traffic. The issue is that without it, the AV can\u2019t scan the web traffic to make sure you don\u2019t download or visit something malicious. This again will add to your security by using it, but it takes away from your privacy and anonymity.</p> <p>When a person wants to remain private, one example is they would need to take actions such as encrypting all their files before being backed up to the cloud. By doing so, no one else would be able to access those files. The cloud provider would be able to see the login details and billing information for that person, thereby they aren\u2019t anonymous but would have extra security and privacy.</p> <p>Being anonymous in today\u2019s age is next to impossible, even if you have \u201cperfect\u201d OPSEC. Even then, if a person becomes the target of a nation state actor, they won\u2019t be able to stay anonymous. There is an unbelievable amount of technology that governments have that can track a person. This isn\u2019t meant to sound defeatist for someone wanting to be anonymous, but if you want to avoid the scrutiny of a government agency, it\u2019s next to impossible once they are onto you. A good read that goes into a lot more detail about this topic is Permanent Record by Edward Snowden.</p> <p>Some people will go as far as to use something like Tails or Whonix. While these are excellent tools, they aren\u2019t going to be of much use for the average person and they will just add a lot of inconvenience. Even if you were to use one of these tools, think about all the other ways you can be tracked by a government or corporation. The purchases you make on your credit/debit card, the banks you use, the stores you shop at, the places you go to in public that are monitored with security cameras, the phone you use, and the list goes on and on.</p> <p>There are small groups of people who have to take rigorous steps to protect themselves, i.e. journalists, but for the vast majority of people, there's no point in letting paranoia take your life over. There are sections in this website where you'll learn more about cutting down on some of the monitoring, but there isn\u2019t a point in going crazy over this stuff. If you make sure your security and privacy is taken care of to even a moderate degree, then you'll be leagues ahead of most people.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/socialengineering/","title":"Social Engineering","text":"<p>This is by far becoming the greatest threat facing individuals, businesses, and governments today in the cyber world. In all of the threats that I listed above, some level of social engineering plays into them. While definitions may vary slightly, the general consensus is that social engineering is getting a target to reveal information or take a specific action for malicious reasons. So whether it be getting someone to click on a fake download link, install ransomware, or respond to a phishing campaign, it all falls under the realm of social engineering. Some hackers are just much better at this than others.</p> <p>Understanding the theory behind social engineering is critical in being able to recognize and counter it. This isn\u2019t easy to do and can\u2019t be learned overnight, as psychology is very heavily involved with this. Someone who is very committed to infiltrating a business and who has a lot of interpersonal skills and technological understanding, would be able to do so if the business wasn\u2019t properly prepared.</p> <p>In the book recommendations section, I list some books to help you learn more about this topic. As there is a lot of psychology and theory involved here, the books can be a dry read, but it\u2019s very powerful information. It just requires a commitment to learn and understand it. Once you do, you\u2019ll be much better protected, not just from a cyber perspective, but from a real life perspective as well. You\u2019ll learn about the thinking behind those who are criminals and the motivations of them. Being aware of the evil nature of some people will also help you grasp how some people can commit some of the atrocious things they do.</p> <p>Add some skepticism</p> <p>You should really add some skepticism when you're dealing with people. For example, phone scams are still very popular and use things like the area code of your phone to trick you into answering. The scammer will then try to get certain pieces of personal info from you that would give them an idea of who you are and where you live. They will also make fake scenarios where they will say that you or a family member is in some sort of trouble. They are using common manipulation techniques when they do this, i.e. urgency, to get you to do what they want.</p> <p>This is a very in-depth topic that can\u2019t be fully fleshed out as it would be a gigantic section because of all the psychology aspects, but here are some things to look out for. Hackers will use multiple angles to get their target to do what the hacker wants them to do. The hacker will try to use emotions to sway the target such as curiosity and fear. This could take place in the form of something such as a hacker sending a carefully worded convincing email to a target, giving them just enough information to make the target curious, that they do something such as clicking on an attachment.</p> <p>The most dangerous route that a hacker can take is to build trust with you. Someone who understands the human psyche well will use many different approaches all combined in a seamless manner to build that trust until they can eventually spring the trap. This isn\u2019t meant to make you hyper suspicious of people, just realize that someone who starts emailing you out of the blue may have bad intentions in mind. As I have time to continue building this site out, I will cover social engineering in more detail about how to protect yourself.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/socialmedia/","title":"Social Media Usage","text":"<p>This is a hot topic for a lot of people, especially the ones who like to post their entire lives online for everyone to see. If you\u2019ve already made the decision to post a bunch of your personal life online, you can attempt to do damage control and clean it up as best you can, but a lot of it is going to remain there forever. This is a personal decision for people to make, but to use social media for anything other than business seems ridiculous. Instead of spending hours everyday wasting your life looking at other people\u2019s photos and lives, you could create something for yourself.</p> <p>Something to keep in mind is that every time you use a free product, you are the product. Social media is an example, and I\u2019ll use Facebook to illustrate this. When you look at posts, watch videos, follow pages, post, etc, Facebook tracks all of that to create an advertising profile of you. This is so specific that if you watch a Facebook video on your phone and you laugh at a certain section, Facebook will see that from your camera and microphone (which you freely give them access to), and will recommend more content similar to that. Another example that you can easily test for yourself is to talk about a product that you want or need. If Facebook is installed on your phone, it will eventually recommend ads for that product. The advertising industry is massive for social media and won\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon.</p> <p>I mentioned in the previous paragraph about these apps being able to access your microphone and camera. It is much more insidious than that. Look at social media apps on the Apple and Google store and see the amount of permissions they require and the amount of data they collect.</p> <p>Apple is much better than Google and this is an absolute travesty even for Apple. Go look at the Google Play version for Facebook and see what kind of information is collected. It was so long that I would have had to take several screenshots just to show what is collected, so I will list some of the items. The app will collect your location, personal info such as address, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, your financial info, health info, emails, text messages, photos and videos, audio files, calendar events, contacts, app activity, web browsing history, and the list goes on. This isn\u2019t me picking on Facebook, this issue is prevalent with all social media apps, as well as many other phone apps.</p> <p>To sum all this up, if you use social media, you lose a considerable amount of privacy. You also need to think carefully about anything you post. To be completely blunt, common sense is extremely important and unfortunately, many lack it. Using the previous paragraph as an example, through no fault of your own, someone else could have a lot of your info leaked just because they do something stupid. Don\u2019t live in a bubble, but also make sure you use some sense. I don\u2019t recommend being one of those people that are \u201cterminally online.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"opsec/socialmedia/#limiting-personal-info-online","title":"Limiting Personal Info Online","text":"<p>This section is extremely important for those trying to prevent doxxing. I made this under the social media section, since this is where most people are putting their personal info these days. A lot of you probably already have a lot of your info online that could be used to correlate who you are in real life and the websites you visit. Outside of niche cases, like being a public figure, there is no sense in having your online persona be the same as your real life persona. Social media is going to be one obvious exception to this, especially since some platforms are starting to implement ID verification.</p> <p>To use a simple example here, using an email with your name, your birth year or the birth year of one of your kids, and so on, can be used to correlate a lot of your activity online. Let\u2019s say you use several dozen different websites and have accounts with them using that email, and some of them you wouldn\u2019t want people to know you use. Using any combo of personal info like that in an email address, someone can now piece a lot of your activity together. One of the most common examples of this happening is when data breaches happen. It\u2019s unfortunately becoming more common, and is more reason to limit the info you give out to others.</p> <p>One of the most egregious things I see are the people that share posts with their friends taking some moronic quiz. The quiz will ask things like what\u2019s your middle name, what\u2019s your birth date, who\u2019re your parents, where were you born, and so on. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people fill these out and post for everyone to see. Some of them may be \u201charmless,\u201d but if I had to guess, I would say a lot of those quiz sites are made by threat actors who fish for anything to use. Someone with some training or experience could use that info to devastating effect.</p> <p>Think before you post</p> <p>This needs to be said as a reminder if nothing else - you should think before you post on these platforms. People like to get worked up into a rage because they see something they don't like and they think their opinion on the hot new current topic \u2122\ufe0f will do something to shift the balance of the world. Just because something can be said doesn't mean it should be said. People that engage in that kind of behavior should really start to think more about not bringing shame to themselves and their family by acting like a clown.</p> <p>Social media is also heavily rooted in psychology. The people behind these platforms know what they need to do to keep people addicted. Twitter is a perfect example of this. The app has been a toxic dumpster fire for years and despite people saying they would leave because of new ownership, they are still there posting toxic garbage and getting worked up over the opinions of others. Rather than use the platform for something positive, most people go there to act like clowns for everyone to see. Other social media platforms also have this issue as well, though Twitter seems to be one of the worst.</p> <p>If you happen to have already been the victim of a data breach or you\u2019ve tied your real life tightly with your online life, don\u2019t worry. The world isn\u2019t going to end. You can always start to make changes in how you interact online to start mitigating the damage.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/telemetry/","title":"Telemetry","text":"<p>This section is going to cover the massive money printing machine that is telemetry and data collection. Long ago, this stuff was used in limited forms to improve on products and to a small extent, it still is. If you developed a piece of software and had a way to track how many people had crashes and what the problem was, it was useful in being able to improve the product. These days, it has become downright invasive and what many companies were doing became illegal in places like Europe due to laws like the GDPR. Even today, companies are still being fined because they can\u2019t be bothered to respect the privacy of their customers.</p> <p>There are a few different ways that companies are collecting info on people. Telemetry is one way. For example, someone that uses Windows Home edition will have a ton of data collected about what their hardware is, what they search, what they click on, and so on. Then there is data collection, where companies are mass harvesting things like names, phone numbers, addresses, etc, by using things like fillable forms and downloading and using mobile apps. Then there is something called fingerprinting, which is absolutely insidious. This page will cover each one of them.</p> <p>Telemetry is going to be found in just about every Big Tech product and service, and even many small companies are using it. Many games are an example of this. There have been a few different developers in recent years that have either implemented or wanted to implement this kind of data collection in their games. Some of them decided to back off due to community backlash. Some others didn\u2019t give a damn and went ahead with it anyway. One of the worst examples are the developers that make single player games that are required to be online. This is just to allow for more spying on their customers. I see a lot of people, usually the hardcore fans of those companies, play mental gymnastics and defend the dev behavior.</p> <p>If you want to really crack down on this garbage, you need to start at the bottom and work your way up. This starts with your choice of operating systems. Microsoft and Apple collect a lot of data on their desktop OS products. To some extent, you\u2019ll be able to block it but you can\u2019t shut it down 100%. I have no issue using either Windows or MacOS and I also really like them both, but I also know how to configure them to my liking. If no telemetry is critical for you, you\u2019ll need to look at a Linux distro.</p> <p>Before I go any further, I\u2019ll tell you I like all the desktop operating systems. They all have their purpose. I\u2019m not a die hard fan of anything. Having an open mind is crucial, especially in the tech world. I also believe that people should be able to use whatever they damn well please.</p> <p>When you pick your OS, you\u2019ll need to work your way up to the software you use. For example, if you use Linux or a highly tuned version of Windows, your OS will be very private. Then you need to think about the different browser choices, apps that are going to be installed, what will be allowed to run at startup, and so on. There are billions of different combinations of what this could look like due to the choices available, so I can\u2019t possibly cover every one of them. Make sure to look into each one, decide whether you want closed or open source programs, read privacy policies, etc.</p> <p>Next, we\u2019ll go over data collection. A lot of common sense needs to be applied here. You shouldn\u2019t just be giving out your name, phone number, or any other personal info to anyone asking for it. Determine what you are willing to risk. For example, if you are signing up for a regulated product or service, you may be asked to give really sensitive information like your social security number. Think ahead on this, like what would happen if that company got hacked and all of the info you gave were to be leaked online. This goes for everything, even what you believe is secure and private. There\u2019s not really more to add to this.</p> <p>The last item to cover is fingerprinting. This is a nasty and invasive way to collect info and it is more or less impossible to protect yourself against. Fingerprinting is used to create a unique digital fingerprint of every device that uses the internet. Some of the info that\u2019s collected is things like GPU used, OS and the version used, the browser used and any extensions, time zone, and many other data points.</p> <p>The more you try to protect yourself against this, the more unique you become. For example, if you just used vanilla Chrome with no extensions, you\u2019ll blend in with a lot of other people, although you\u2019d have to deal with annoying garbage like ads. If you use LibreWolf or Firefox and load up a few extensions, you\u2019ll all of a sudden stand out.</p> <p>I\u2019ll give you an analogy for this. Imagine everyone is walking around wearing the same clothes and has their faces exposed, which could be Chrome users in this instance. No one is really going to stand out. Now imagine you, a LibreWolf user, is wearing a face mask and completely different clothing from everyone else. You're going to stand out like a turd in the middle of the carpet. You might have your identity \u201cconcealed,\u201d but you have drawn a lot of attention. For the record, I really like LibreWolf, it's just that they have such a small userbase that there isn't much of a pool of people to blend in with.</p> <p>I would not recommend using the internet with invasive browsers or not using adblock, since you will have to deal with a lot of annoying garbage. The downside is your fingerprint is going to be somewhat unique. There are some limited ways around this. You could use the Tor browser for example, but that has niche use cases. Overall, I just don\u2019t recommend worrying about fingerprinting. Browsers like Firefox are being made more resistant to it, but it still has a ways to go. For more info on good browsers, check out the network security section.</p>"},{"location":"opsec/threatmodel/","title":"Threat Model","text":"<p>Building your threat model is something that will likely take some time and thought, and will likely change over time as your life and circumstances change. A threat model is something that can apply to you digitally as well as in real life. In this section, I\u2019ll stay mostly within the digital realm though there may be some crossover. Things really start to change in what you have to do and consider when building a real life threat model.</p> <p>First, like I\u2019ve mentioned in the disclaimers on this site, when you add more to security, privacy, and/or anonymity, you\u2019re going to experience more of a hassle in what you\u2019re trying to do. If your threat model dictated using something like Qubes, you\u2019re going to have to deal with a lot more headache than using something like Windows. There\u2019s other things that add only a small amount of inconvenience like 2FA, while adding greatly to security.</p> <p>Next, I\u2019m going to reiterate what I\u2019ve already said multiple times on this site. Nothing is ever 100% secure and everything can be hacked. In the government and business world, cybersecurity staff prepare for when, not if, they get hacked. Give it enough time, and you\u2019re going to experience a cyber incident of some sort. It could either be something you did like download malware, or something completely out of your control, like a service you use gets hacked and your personal information goes with it.</p> <p>From there, think about what you\u2019re trying to protect, who you\u2019re trying to protect against, what you need to do to protect against these threats, the amount of hassle you\u2019re willing to do to protect yourself from the threats, and what steps you\u2019ll need to take after a cyber incident. Again, prepare for WHEN something happens, not IF it happens. This mindset will help you be a lot more prepared. Now let\u2019s go through each of those items I listed.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>There's a popular phrase in the military community that goes, \"Two is one, one is none.\" The idea here is to make sure you have backups for whatever you're doing. In this case, you should have a backup plan for your backup plan and so on. Anything that can go wrong probably will, especially in a bad situation. If something drastic happens in a cyber context (like someone gets access to your financial accounts) and you don't have a plan, you're life is going to be total chaos because you weren't ready and the recovery will take way longer. If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.</p> <p>What do you want to protect? Is it some emails, is it some personal files you have stored locally or on the cloud, or is it your entire system and all its contents? Take time on this step and with all the other steps. Make a plan on what you\u2019re looking to do.</p> <p>Who are you trying to protect against? Are you a journalist who\u2019s writing stories that could anger a government agency? Maybe you\u2019re a typical home user who just wants to protect against friends and family from being able to snoop on your computer when you\u2019re not around.</p> <p>What do you need to do to protect yourself from these threats? This could be something simple, like running an AV and a good firewall to keep intruders out of your device, or it could be something convoluted like using Qubes, routing all your traffic through Tor, and having numerous online identities.</p> <p>How much hassle are you willing to go through to protect yourself? Are you willing to just do simple things like use 2FA on all your accounts, or are you willing to use Whonix, air gapped computers, or some other extreme measures that will slow you down?</p> <p>What steps do you need to take after a cyber incident? At minimum you\u2019ll end up needing to change your passwords. You may even need to make new email addresses, change phone numbers, wipe some data, etc.</p> <p>This might seem like a lot but it\u2019s important to get this figured out. I can see a case why a typical home user might not need to concern themselves with this much. There\u2019s plenty of people who need to plan this out though, among them would be people in a position of higher risk like journalists, senior military officials, business executives, etc.</p>"}]}
